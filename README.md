# PictureOrganizerScript
This is a script I wrote for my dad for father's day. This will transfer all the pictures from his camera to the appropriate directories. He can enter the name of the file he wants to create in a little window that pops up. If the file has already been created, it will just go further into the subdirectories.



**Name of File**: Type in a name in the tkinter window that pops up.

**Year_Current**: Current year

**Month**: Month the picture was created.

**Day**: Day the picture was created.

**Year**: Year the picture was created.



## It will store it in this format:

E:\\My Digital Camera Pictures\\[Year_Current] Pictures\\[Year] [Month]-[Day]-[Year] - [Name of File]\\[All Pictures Go Here]



## The pictures are copied and renamed in the following format:

[Year] - [Month] - [Day] - [Year] - [Name of File] - #[Picture Number] of [Total Number of Pictures].JPG



It will only grab and copy any extensions that are JPG.
