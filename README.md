# PictureOrganizerScript
This is a script I wrote for my dad for father's day. I couldn't buy him anything because I'm broke, so I made him this for when he transfers pictures to his computer. Originally, this would take him about 30 minutes to do because he would have to rename each picture and store them in their appropriates directories, but now it can be done in seconds :) He can enter the name of the file he wants to create in a little window that pops up. If the file has already been created, it will just go further into the subdirectories.



Name of File: Type in a name in the tkinter window that pops up.

Year_Current: Current year

Month: Month the picture was created.

Day: Day the picture was created.

Year: Year the picture was created.



It will store it in this format:

E:\My Digital Camera Pictures\[Year_Current] Pictures\[Year] [Month]-[Day]-[Year] - [Name of File]\[All Pictures Go Here]



The pictures are copied and renamed in the following format:

[Year] - [Month] - [Day] - [Year] - [Name of File] - #[Picture Number] of [Total Number of Pictures].JPG



It will only grab and copy any extensions that are JPG.
